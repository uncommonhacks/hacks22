          Founded in 2016, Uncommon Hacks is a weekend-long celebration of
          technology where college students worldwide come to Chicago to make fun,
          random, and innovative tech-related projects with friends old and new.
          Every year, we work hard to create a hackathon where all are welcome,
          regardless of experience or background, and where outside-the-box projects
          and creative thinking are encouraged. For our sixth annual hackathon last
          spring, we hosted over 200 of the brightest and most motivated students
          from universities around the world. You can get an idea of what goes on at
          Uncommon Hacks by checking out our

          Hackathons are invention marathons where attendees collaborate on a
          project over the course of a weekend! Hackers will be in a fun,
          supportive environment with the necessary tools and mentorship
          provided to create weird, quirky, and amazing projects that creatively
          explore new ideas with code or solve unconventional problems.
          University and high school students from anywhere are welcome, even if
          you're not a computer science major or have never been to a hackathon
          before! We've written a guide for first-time hackers available

          Regular applications open on the week of Feb. 21 and will be due
          around two weeks later. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.
          You can participate as long as you're a student enrolled in a high
          school or university, or you have graduated within the last 12 months.
          We aim to be beginner-friendly, so all are welcome! Check back on this

          April 1st - 3rd, 2022 — HYBRID

          <br /><br />

          HYBRID: If you're a UChicago student, you're welcome to attend the
          event in-person. Non-UChicago students unfortunately will not be
          allowed to attend the event in-person, though all are open to attend
          the hackathon virtually. The same programming will be available for
          both in-person and virtual participants, so don't fret either way!

          <br /><br />

          WHERE: If you're attending in-person, we'll be having an assortment of
          in-person events on the UChicago campus, as well as some virtual
          events. Details of locations and times will be sent to in-person
          participants in advance. If attending virtually, all links and info
          will be included in our hacker guide, which will be sent out before
          the event begins. We anticipate using Gather.Town and Discord for all
          hackers!

          <br /><br />

          Uncommon Hacks is free to attend. We will not offer travel
          reimbursement. If you're participating virtually, the only traveling
          you'll be doing is to our Gather.Town...for which you'll be reimbursed
          with e-love.

          The process starts out with the hackathon application, which consists
          of basic demographic questions as well as a few ~mystery~ short answer
          ones. The Uncommon Hacks team will be reviewing the applications in
          waves, and you will be notified via email with the result of your
          application. If you've been accepted, you will have an RSVP link to
          complete as confirmation of your attendance. from there, you're all
          set - see you on our adventure!

          You are encouraged to work in teams of up to four (4) people!
          Collaborating with hackers across different schools is especially
          welcome. We will offer plenty of opportunities for you to meet new
          people and make teams.

          Even if you have limited coding or technical experience, we will have
          plenty of talks and workshops scheduled to introduce you to a plethora
          of different tools and technologies. We will also have mentors
          available throughout the weekend to help out if you ever get stuck or
          run out of ideas.
