          Founded in 2016, Uncommon Hacks is a weekend-long celebration of
          technology where college students worldwide come to Chicago to make fun,
          random, and innovative tech-related projects with friends old and new.
          Every year, we work hard to create a hackathon where all are welcome,
          regardless of experience or background, and where outside-the-box projects
          and creative thinking are encouraged. For our sixth annual hackathon last
          spring, we hosted over 200 of the brightest and most motivated students
          from universities around the world. You can get an idea of what goes on at
          Uncommon Hacks by checking out our

      <h3>
        Game Design
      </h3>
      <p>Since you probably won’t have enough time to make a game that’s super well-polished, the emphasis in this category is on creativity. As long as your program processes user input in some way, it’s considered a game, so the possibilities are endless! We’ll support you no matter what project you choose to work on, whether that’s a clicker game that makes use of the user’s camera, a three-dimensional version of snake, or a UChicago-themed rogue-like.

      <h3>
        Web Development
      </h3>
      <p>If you’re interested in making a project that can be accessed by a large number of people, then this category is for you! Web-based projects are usually built with some kind of social goal in mind, whether that involves spreading information, bringing people together, or just making statements. As with other categories, you may choose to make your project more serious, like developing the prototype for a groundbreaking social network, or more casual, like creating a virtual garden that anyone can help take care of.

        Data Analysis
      </h3>
      <p>Did you know that there’s an entire subreddit devoted to uncovering cool datasets? Combine this with the countless ways of processing and visualizing data, and you have the potential for a vast variety of different projects! You may choose to stick to something more global, like analyzing the spread of internet usage in countries around the world. Or perhaps something more local, like finding common trends in course evals or your own social media DMs.

        Programmatic Art
      </h3>
      <p>New for Uncommon Hacks 2022, you can think of projects in this category as being similar to video games, but with the intent of artistic expression. These creations tend to involve forms and shapes that oscillate and change with certain variables, like time, or perhaps the weather forecast or your Spotify jams. There are almost no rules here (just write some code!), so be as creative as you’d like!

              Hackathons are invention marathons where attendees collaborate on a
              project over the course of a weekend! Hackers will be in a fun,
              supportive environment with the necessary tools and mentorship
              provided to create weird, quirky, and amazing projects that creatively
              explore new ideas with code or solve unconventional problems.
              University and high school students from anywhere are welcome, even if
              you're not a computer science major or have never been to a hackathon
              before! We've written a guide for first-time hackers available

              April 1st - 3rd, 2022 — HYBRID
    
              <br /><br />
    
              HYBRID: If you're a UChicago student, you're welcome to attend the
              event in-person. Non-UChicago students unfortunately will not be
              allowed to attend the event in-person, though all are open to attend
              the hackathon virtually. The same programming will be available for
              both in-person and virtual participants, so don't fret either way!
    
              <br /><br />
    
              WHERE: If you're attending in-person, we'll be having an assortment of
              in-person events on the UChicago campus, as well as some virtual
              events. Details of locations and times will be sent to in-person
              participants in advance. If attending virtually, all links and info
              will be included in our hacker guide, which will be sent out before
              the event begins. We anticipate using Gather.Town and Discord for all
              hackers!
    
              <br /><br />
    
              Uncommon Hacks is free to attend. We will not offer travel
              reimbursement. If you're participating virtually, the only traveling
              you'll be doing is to our Gather.Town...for which you'll be reimbursed
              with e-love.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              The process starts out with the hackathon application, which consists
              of basic demographic questions as well as a few ~mystery~ short answer
              ones. The Uncommon Hacks team will be reviewing the applications in
              waves, and you will be notified via email with the result of your
              application. If you've been accepted, you will have an RSVP link to
              complete as confirmation of your attendance. from there, you're all
              set - see you on our adventure!

              You are encouraged to work in teams of up to four (4) people!
              Collaborating with hackers across different schools is especially
              welcome. We will offer plenty of opportunities for you to meet new
              people and make teams.
